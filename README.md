# Data Visualisation Vac Work For UCT's Antartic Sensor Bouy

This repository serves as a share point for work done to visualise information that will be sent from a satelight link on a bouy that is planning to be sent to antartica circa 2022.
The work was done speculatively as the shape of the data, list of values, etc were still to be finalised when this was developed. 

This project forms more of a proof of concept to handle simulated data and show how the displays should function and flow. 
An Node-Red was used to inject data into an Influx data base. Graphana was used to generate the plots and visualise the data that was injected.
